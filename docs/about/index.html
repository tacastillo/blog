<p>I am a software-engineer-turned-data-scientist that is looking to <em>leap</em> into data science within the healthcare space.</p>
<p>Throughout my time in industry and in college, I have always been fascinated by data and have worked with it extensively.
In college, I performed exploratory data analysis on topics such as <a href="https://tacastillo.github.io/friends">classic sitcoms</a> to how to maximize your bang for your buck at Chipotle.</p>
<p>At my first job out of college at IBM, I worked extensively on a product that visualized KPIs and customer paths for marketing analysts.</p>
<p>My passion for healthcare spun out from the first week of at my second job, Roche. My first project was visualizing treatment paths for patients, and I had the opportunity to look at deidentified clinical records. I followed the rows and tables as it illustrated (virtually on its own) that a patient had received chemotherapy, then received another round of chemo, and then a surgery. Eventually, you hit an aptly named table called <em>Death Certificates</em>. At that moment, I said &ldquo;Oh s***&rdquo; and realized that the data that I was working with wasn&rsquo;t just about touchpoints, but was about the lives of actual people, and that being at the intersection of data and healthcare meant having the responsibility of improving the lives of future patients by building upon the pain and tribulations of past patients. In that short period of time, I decided that I was committed to healthcare and that I wouldn&rsquo;t turn back anymore.</p>
<p>Since then, I have been devoted to exploring the cross of healthcare and data science. I have done this through various projects at Roche, a part-time Master&rsquo;s in Health Data Science. This is in addition to side projects that I have been working on, such as <a href="https://github.com/tacastillo/du-machine-learning">predicting length of stay</a> or classifying whether or not a patient will be <a href="https://github.com/tacastillo/sepsis-readmissions">re-admitted for sepsis</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting my blog and I hope you enjoy the content!</p>
