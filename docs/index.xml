      <description>Today was a light day. I did a bunch of reading for grad school. For context, while working I&amp;rsquo;m pursuing a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Health Data Science from the University of Denver. One of the huge perks that I&amp;rsquo;m finding consistently throughout the program is that not only am I learn a lot about data science, but also everything ties in to healthcare in some way.
Readings The readings that I focused on today was a literature review of how data mining can be used in healthcare.</description>

      <description>Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s intentially a -1.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a journey of #66DaysOfData for the past 20 or so days. The original concept of this is to dedicate at least 5 minutes a day learning or working towards something data science-related.
Some people would think I had misread it because I&amp;rsquo;ve been pouring in close to 5 hours a day on this for the past few weeks.
This is my chronicle of things I&amp;rsquo;ve done to work towards becoming a data scientist.</description>

      <description>Hi, My name is Tim! I am a software-engineer-turned-data-scientist that is looking to leap into data science within the healthcare space.
Throughout my time in industry and in college, I have always been fascinated by data and have worked with it extensively. In college, I performed exploratory data analysis on topics such as classic sitcoms to how to maximize your bang for your buck at Chipotle.
At my first job out of college at IBM, I worked extensively on a product that visualized KPIs and customer paths for marketing analysts.</description>
