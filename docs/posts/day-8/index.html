I had an interview with a hiring manager today. I think it generally went well. I did well explaining my technical projects and such, but struggled to talk about &ldquo;Why I Want to Work Here&rdquo; and &ldquo;What Culture Are You Looking For&rdquo; questions.
I read up on A/B tests, metrics to evaluate by, different patterns and effects common in A/B tests and how to conduct and assess them statistically, which is always fun.">

<p>I read up on A/B tests, metrics to evaluate by, different patterns and effects common in A/B tests and how to conduct and assess them statistically, which is always fun.</p>
<p>Then I did 4 SQL problems on StrataScratch, which is a platform where people submit SQL/Python questions along with solutions and video explanations.</p>
<p>Rounding off my evening with some light readings on DIKW (Data -&gt; Information -&gt; Knowledge -&gt; Wisdom) for my Health Data Mining class.</p>
