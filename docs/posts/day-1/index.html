				<p>Today was also a light day. I was primarily focused on work, so therefore I didn&rsquo;t get to do much studying. I reviewed some SQL interview questions as that&rsquo;s probably one of my weaker points.</p>
<p>I was supposed to have an interview on this interviewing platform called <a href="https://www.pramp.com">Pramp</a>, but I didn&rsquo;t get paired up with anyone today.</p>
<p>Has anyone heard of the platform called <a href="https://www.sharpestminds.com/">SharpestMinds</a>? It&rsquo;s a website that pairs you up with coaches and mentors in data science. I was interested in looking into prospective mentors for the short-term and reached out to a few. Today, I had a call with one of them. Surprisingly, I was asked to do a SQL and Python question. Even more surprisingly, I felt like I did pretty well on them. It was a great confidence boost for the first day of this jamboree.</p>
<p>I also submitted a couple job applications.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to hoping that I&rsquo;ll be able to spend more time studying in the next 65 days!</p>
