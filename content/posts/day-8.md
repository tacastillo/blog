Today was a hodgepodge of different things to practice.

I had an interview with a hiring manager today. I think it generally went well. I did well explaining my technical projects and such, but struggled to talk about "Why I Want to Work Here" and "What Culture Are You Looking For" questions.

I read up on A/B tests, metrics to evaluate by, different patterns and effects common in A/B tests and how to conduct and assess them statistically, which is always fun.

Then I did 4 SQL problems on StrataScratch, which is a platform where people submit SQL/Python questions along with solutions and video explanations.

Rounding off my evening with some light readings on DIKW (Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Wisdom) for my Health Data Mining class.
