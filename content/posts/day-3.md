Today I had a phone screen with a recruiter today. It went well enough that they want me to talk to the hiring manager next week. So fingers crossed on that!

I wanted to build something a little more visual today, so I spent half an hour using Plotly Dash to build out [COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Map](https://covid-vaccine-map.herokuapp.com/). I posted it on LinkedIn with a screenshot, so hopefully it will catch some people's attention.

I also did 3 SQL problems on LeetCode. I was able to solve two of them, however struggled with the first one. I learned about patterns such as self-joining by using `FROM` and picking up multiple tables from it. In addition to that, I got exposure to using window functions and using the `HAVING` clause when using `GROUP BY`.
