Today was also a light day. I was primarily focused on work, so therefore I didn't get to do much studying. I reviewed some SQL interview questions as that's probably one of my weaker points.

I was supposed to have an interview on this interviewing platform called [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com), but I didn't get paired up with anyone today.

Has anyone heard of the platform called [SharpestMinds](https://www.sharpestminds.com/)? It's a website that pairs you up with coaches and mentors in data science. I was interested in looking into prospective mentors for the short-term and reached out to a few. Today, I had a call with one of them. Surprisingly, I was asked to do a SQL and Python question. Even more surprisingly, I felt like I did pretty well on them. It was a great confidence boost for the first day of this jamboree.

I also submitted a couple job applications.

Here's to hoping that I'll be able to spend more time studying in the next 65 days!
