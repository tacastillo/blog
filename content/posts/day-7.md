Hi folks!

I didn't get to do anything yesterday, so I tried making up for it today.

Today, I finished up a project that I was working on for grad school. The course is on Health Data Mining and the current module is all about what data mining is and how it fits within healthcare.

I also tackled 4 SQL problems, with a flub on the 5th. Things I learned from solving the SQL problems:
* I sometimes overengineer solutions because I forget about simple functionality like `LIMIT` or `DISTINCT`
* My SQL framework is going quite well! However it does sometimes lead to making a more complicated solution than necessary.
* I need to take notes and read through the problems more thoroughly or else I'll keep making mistakes.
