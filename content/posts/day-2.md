I've been putting in extra time into work the past couple days and it's starting to show in how I haven't been able to study and put in time into my projects.

I did 3 SQL Leetcode questions. I'm trying to get more comfortable working on SQL questions as I know that's one of my weaker points. My goal is to be able to pull away and learn one thing from every Leetcode question that I attempt.

I did some readings for grad school, namely a literature review on data mining in healthcare.
