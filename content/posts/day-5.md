Sometimes it is necessary to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.

Therefore, I focused on meta-learning and thinking about how I want to process problems.

For the next few days, I want to focus on figuring out how to build a mental framework for answering interview questions.

The focus for today was on tackling SQL questions.

Here is my 7-step guide/framework to approaching SQL questions:

1. Establish the assumptions
2. Define the output, if not provided
3. Define the intermediate data structure
4. Work backwards from the beginning
5. Make a CTE with the intermediate data structure
6. If it requires a second intermediate data structure, make it
7. Go from the beginning and meet it in the middle
