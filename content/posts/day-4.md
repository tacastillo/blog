Today, I focused on getting some good ol' SQL practice in. I solved 4 SQL problems, one of which was a LeetCode hard.

My learnings from doing those problems were: when to use RANK() vs DENSE_RANK(), that JOINs accept *expressions* and not something fancy, so you can join on ANDs and ORs and inequalities.

I'm also slowly figuring out my patterns. I think I'm going to take a break tomorrow and focus on meta-learning and getting my processes in place for how to approach things.

Here's a short list of what I want to write down:
* My STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) answers for specific questions
* How to approach an SQL problem
* How to approach a technical problem
* How to approach a business case question
